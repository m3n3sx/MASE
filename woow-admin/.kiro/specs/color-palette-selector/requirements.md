# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the CSS implementation for a color palette selector component in the MASE (Modern Admin Styler Engine) WordPress plugin. The palette selector allows administrators to quickly apply pre-defined color schemes to their WordPress admin interface through an intuitive visual grid interface.

## Glossary

- **MASE**: Modern Admin Styler Engine - the WordPress plugin system
- **Palette Card**: A visual card component displaying a single color palette with preview and controls
- **Color Circle**: A circular visual element displaying a single color from a palette
- **Active State**: Visual indication that a palette is currently applied to the admin interface
- **Responsive Grid**: A layout system that adapts column count based on viewport width
- **Admin Interface**: The WordPress administrative dashboard area
